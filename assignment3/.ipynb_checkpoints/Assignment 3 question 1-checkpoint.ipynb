    "## Question 1: Siamese networks & one-shot learning (8pt)\n",
    "The Cifar-100 dataset is similar to the Cifar-10 dataset. It also consists of 60,000 32x32 RGB images, but they are distributed over 100 classes instead of 10. Thus, each class has much less examples, only 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. For more info about the dataset, see https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "*HINT: Import the Cifar-100 dataset directly from Keras, no need to download it from the website. Use* `label_mode=\"fine\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1.1: Siamese network\n",
    "**a)**\n",
    "* Train a Siamese Network on the first 80 classes of (the training set of) Cifar-100, i.e. let the network predict the probability that two input images are from the same class. Use 1 as a target for pairs of images from the same class (positive pairs), and 0 for pairs of images from different classes (negative pairs). Randomly select image pairs from Cifar-100, but make sure you train on as many positive pairs as negative pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluate the performance of the network on 20-way one-shot learning tasks. Do this by generating 250 random tasks and obtain the average accuracy for each evaluation round. Use the remaining 20 classes that were not used for training. The model should perform better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question you may ignore the test set of Cifar-100; it suffices to use only the training set and split this, using the first 80 classes for training and the remaining 20 classes for one-shot testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*HINT: First sort the data by their labels (see e.g.* `numpy.argsort()`*), then reshape the data to a shape of* `(n_classes, n_examples, width, height, depth)`*, similar to the Omniglot data in Practical 4. It is then easier to split the data by class, and to sample positive and negative images pairs for training the Siamese network.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE: do not expect the one-shot accuracy for Cifar-100 to be similar to that accuracy for Omniglot; a lower accuracy can be expected. However, accuracy higher than random guess is certainly achievable.*"

These amounts of filters were necessary to catch all the features of the images and obtain an accuracy higher than random guessing. Between each convolutional layers there are Maxpool layers with size 2x2 to reduce the dimensionality of the image, followed by batch normalization to increase the training speed and dropout to avoid overfitting on the train data. The last convolutional layer is followed by a Flatten layer en subsequently a dense hidden layer with 1024 neurons and sigmoid activation in order to limit the output vector of an image to zeros and ones. This model is taken as both the left and right input leg of the next model which only has a dense layer with one neuron and sigmoid activation, because it is binary classification: either the two images are from the same class or not. The loss function belonging to this final model is binary cross entropy, because as said before: it is about binary classification.\n",

    "First major difference is that the Omniglot dataset contains images of a resolution (105x105), while the images in the Cifar-100 dataset are (28x28). Cecause these images are much smaller they contain less features, making it harder to extract global patterns to recognize a character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second difference is that every pixel in the Omniglot dataset has a greyscale from 0 to 1, while every pixel in the image of the Cifar-100 dataset has a RGB code. This might cause that images look less similar to each other and it is more difficult to make the right classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third and last difference is that the Omniglot dataset only consists of 20 classes while the Cifar-100 dataset has 100 classes, from which 80 are used for training and 20 for evaluating the model. Having a larger amount of classes makes it harder to create a model with high accuracy."

    "The CNN architecture consistso of 2 convolutional layers with respectively 32 and 64 filters, this in order to extract enough features from the dataset. After the convolutional layers there is a Maxpool layer to reduce dimensionality, a batch normalization layer to speed up the training process and a dropout layer with a dropout of 0.5, such a high value is necessary to prevent overfitting (which it still does) on the training data. After this there is a Flatten layer which produces a single vector, followed by 2 hidden dense layers with respectively 1024 and 512 neurons with relu activation. Then there is another batch normalization and dropout layer and finally a layer with 80 neurons (1 for each possible class) with softmax activation. This activation is chosen together with the categorical cross entropy loss function because this is a multi-class classification.\n",
